           Camels are mammals with long legs, a big-lipped snout and a humped back. There are two types of camels: 
            dromedary camels, which have one hump, and Bactrian camels, which have two humps. 
            Camels' humps consist of stored fat, which they can metabolize when food and water is scarce.</li>

            Pigeons are gentle, plump, small-billed birds with a skin saddle between the bill and forehead.
                     All pigeons strut about with a characteristic bobbing of the head. 
                    Because of their long wings and powerful flight muscles, they are strong, swift fliers.

            Teddy bears have a depth of character that other toys don't have, 
            and in playing with one a child brings it to life. 
         The bear helps to stimulate and develop their imagination. 
        “Teddy bears encourage this type of imaginative play by their very nature, 
        in a way a gadget or electronic toy can't.”
